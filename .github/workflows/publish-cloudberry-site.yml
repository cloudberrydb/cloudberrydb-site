# publish-cloudberry-site.yml
#
# This workflow builds and publishes the Apache CloudBerry website to cloudberry.apache.org
# The site is built using Node.js and published to the asf-site branch,
# which Apache infrastructure then serves at cloudberry.apache.org
#
# Triggered by:
# - Push to main branch: Builds and publishes to asf-site
# - Pull requests: Builds only (no publish) to verify changes
#
# Requirements:
# - Node.js project with build script in package.json
# - .asf.yaml file in repository root
#
# Notes:
# - Publication only occurs on push events, not pull requests
# - The asf-site branch is protected - only this workflow should modify it
# - Build artifacts are placed in ./build directory
