This tool collects all the necessary files and generates a script that runs the `gdb` command to create a core file readable by an external host. Use this command when technical support personnel needs to collect core files generated by the Cloudberry processes.

## Usage

```shell
gpsupport packcore collect -core <corefile> [-binary <binary> ] 
[-keep_tmp_dir] [-ignore_missing] 
```

## Options

**`-core`**

Corefile name.

**`-binary`**

Binary name that generated the core file.

**`-keep_tmp_dir`**

Do not delete the temporary directory.

**`-ignore_missing`**

Ignore missing libraries.

## Examples

Collect core info for `core.1234` for binary `/usr/local/cloudberry-db/bin/postgres`.

```shell
gpsupport packcore -cmd collect -core core.1234 -binary /usr/local/cloudberry-db/bin/postgres
```
