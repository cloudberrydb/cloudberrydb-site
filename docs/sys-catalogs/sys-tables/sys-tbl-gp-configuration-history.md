# gp_configuration_history

The `gp_configuration_history` table in the `pg_catalog` schema contains information about system changes related to fault detection and recovery operations. The `fts_probe` process logs data to this table, as do certain related management utilities such as `gprecoverseg` and `gpinitsystem`. For example, when you add a new segment and mirror segment to the system, records for these events are logged to `gp_configuration_history`.

The event descriptions stored in this table may be helpful for troubleshooting serious system issues in collaboration with VMware Support technicians.

This table is populated only on the coordinator. This table is defined in the `pg_global` tablespace, meaning it is globally shared across all databases in the system.
