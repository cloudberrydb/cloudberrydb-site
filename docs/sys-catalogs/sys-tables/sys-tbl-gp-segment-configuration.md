# gp_segment_configuration

The `gp_segment_configuration` table in the `pg_catalog` schema contains information about mirroring and segment instance configuration.

|column|type|references|description|
|------|----|----------|-----------|
|`dbid`|smallint| |Unique identifier of a segment (or coordinator) instance.|
|`content`|smallint| |The content identifier for a segment instance. A primary segment instance and its corresponding mirror will always have the same content identifier.<br/><br/>For a segment the value is from 0 to *N*-1, where *N* is the number of primary segments in the system.<br/><br/>For the coordinator, the value is always -1.|
|`role`|char| |The role that a segment is currently running as. Values are `p` (primary) or `m` (mirror).|
|`preferred_role`|char| |The role that a segment was originally assigned at initialization time. Values are `p` (primary) or `m` (mirror).|
|`mode`|char| |The synchronization status of a segment instance with its mirror copy. Values are `s` (Synchronized) or `n` (Not In Sync).<br/><br/> This column always shows `n` for the coordinator segment and `s` for the standby coordinator segment, but these values do not describe the synchronization state for the coordinator segment. Use `gp_stat_replication` to determine the synchronization state between the coordinator and standby coordinator.|
|`status`|char| |The fault status of a segment instance. Values are `u` (up) or `d` (down).|
|`port`|integer| |The TCP port the database server listener process is using.|
|`hostname`|text| |The hostname of a segment host.|
|`address`|text| |The hostname used to access a particular segment instance on a segment host. This value may be the same as `hostname` on systems that do not have per-interface hostnames configured.|
|`datadir`|text| |Segment instance data directory.|
