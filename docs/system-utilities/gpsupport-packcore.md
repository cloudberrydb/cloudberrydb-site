# gpsupport packcore

This tool collects all the necessary files and generates a script that runs the `gdb` command to create a core file readable by an external host. Use this command when VMware Support needs to collect core files generated by the Greenplum processes.

## Usage

```
gpsupport packcore collect -core <corefile> [-binary <binary> ] 
[-keep_tmp_dir] [-ignore_missing] 
```

## Options

-core
:   Corefile name.

-binary
:   Binary name that generated the core file.

-keep_tmp_dir
:   Do not delete the temporary directory.

-ignore_missing
:   Ignore missing libraries.

## Examples

Collect core info for `core.1234` for binary `/usr/local/greenplum-db/bin/postgres`.

```
gpsupport packcore -cmd collect -core core.1234 -binary /usr/local/greenplum-db/bin/postgres
```
