Learn about Cloudberry Database in just a few minutes.

## Overview

Cloudberry Database is an enterprise-level cloud-native database product that's highly elastic, performant, available, and cost-effective. It helps enterprise users handle and analyze large datasets of terabytes and petabytes with ease. HashData's vision is to break down the entry barriers for enterprises to build big data systems and bring out the complete potential of big data resources.

Cloudberry Database's core technical features include:

- Cloud-native architecture, without the architectural constraints seen in traditional MPP databases.
- The computing engine is independent of data storage and metadata management, which provides 
multi-dimensional flexibility.
- Second-level scaling and minute-level node self-healing and recovery, simplifying maintenance tasks. 

Supports online upgrades and multi-active deployment.

- Complete database capabilities, transactional consistency, and full compatibility with PostgreSQL and the 
Greenplum database.
- Supports mainstream analytical tools for machine learning, graph computation, and spatiotemporal analysis.
- Easily integrates with common ETL and BI tools.
- Supports hybrid and integrated data warehouse and data lake solutions.

Cloudberry Database consists of two main modules: a user module and a management module. The top layer of the user module is an independent metadata service layer, the middle is a stateless computing layer, and the bottom layer is a shared data storage layer. The management module incorporates the management console (Cloud Manager) that manages all metadata clusters and computing clusters, including cluster creation, startup and shutdown, and resource management, monitoring, and alerts.

## Advantages

- Cloud-native architecture: Cloudberry Database is built from scratch to leverage cloud computing advantages, ensuring high elasticity and availability by segregating storage, computation, and metadata. This approach eliminates the architectural constraints of traditional MPP databases and delivers a robust big data platform.
- Multi-dimensional elastic scaling capability: Cloudberry Database scales storage and computation resources independently to adjust throughput, response time, and data capacity horizontally, vertically, and in storage.
- Comprehensive database capability: Cloudberry Database supports UTF-8, GBK, and other encoding formats, multi-tenant management, relational data models, and standard SQL syntax. It facilitates strong consistency in ACID transactions and provides partition management and popular interfaces like JDBC and ODBC.
- Rich analytical features: The database and data warehouse products, PostgreSQL and Greenplum Database, bring advanced analytical features to Cloudberry Database, which has been customized for cloud platforms to support distributed machine learning and spatiotemporal analysis. It has the ANSI SQL 2008 standard and the 2003 OLAP extension and supports languages, including PL/Pgsql, PL/C, PL/Python, PL/Java, and PL/R. 
- Cloudberry Database natively supports Apache MADlib (an in-database machine learning library based on SQL) and PostGIS.
- ETL and BI Tool Integration: Cloudberry Database easily merges with many ETL and BI tools typically used in the database industry. 

## Future work

Our Cloudberry Database's open-source work is ongoing. Detailed and organized documentation will be available in the upcoming months.
